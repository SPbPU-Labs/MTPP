# Data Augmentation And Multiprocessing Techniques

**Exercise:** For this assignment, you will select an imbalanced image dataset 
and implement a data augmentation pipeline.  Your pipeline should generate new images 
using transformations like horizontal flipping, rotation (by specified angles), and zooming. 
Critically, you will compare the execution time of this augmentation process 
when run on a single processing core versus multiple cores.
